# Operating Systems: Concepts, Functions, and Interfaces

This file summarizes the key concepts of operating systems (OS), including their functions, history, components, and interfaces.

## What is an Operating System?

An OS is the most important program in a computer. It acts as a bridge between hardware and application software. It controls, supervises, and supports the entire computer system.

## Main Functions of an OS

1. **Hardware Management**
   - Manages and allocates CPU, memory, and I/O devices
   - Ensures efficient use of hardware through scheduling

2. **User Interface**
   - Hides complex hardware operations from users
   - Offers GUI (Graphical User Interface) or CLI (Command Line Interface)

3. **Services and Security**
   - Shares programs and data
   - Provides user access control, data protection, and error recovery

## History of Operating Systems

| Period        | Key Development                               |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------|
| No OS         | Users manually executed one program at a time |
| 1950s         | Batch processing systems                      |
| 1960s         | Interactive processing, time-sharing          |
| 1970s         | General-purpose systems, multi-user support   |
| Modern Era    | GUI-based systems, multitasking, cloud-based  |

## Types of Operating Systems

### 1. Based on Tasking
- **Single-tasking**: One app at a time (e.g., MS-DOS)
- **Multitasking**: Run multiple apps (e.g., Windows, UNIX)

### 2. Based on User Support
- **Single-user**: Supports one user at a time
- **Multi-user**: Allows simultaneous access (e.g., UNIX)

---

## Major OS Components

1. **Processor Manager**  
   - Schedules and manages CPU tasks

2. **Memory Manager**  
   - Handles allocation and deallocation of RAM

3. **File Manager**  
   - Organizes and controls access to files and directories

4. **Device Manager**  
   - Coordinates hardware like printers, keyboards, etc.

---

## OS Interfaces

### 1. GUI (Graphical User Interface)
- Uses Windows, Icons, Menus, Pointer (WIMP)
- Easy for beginners
- Examples: Windows, macOS, Ubuntu

### 2. CLI (Command Line Interface)
- User types commands
- Powerful and flexible for advanced users
- Example: UNIX/Linux

### 3. Menu Interface
- Text-based options
- Used in systems like ATMs or BIOS

---

## UNIX Operating System

- Developed in 1973 using C language
- Two main versions:
  - **System V** (industrial use)
  - **BSD** (used in academia)

### Key Features:
- Multi-user, multitasking, and multithreaded
- High security and command-line based
- Used in cloud services, servers, and macOS

### Architecture:
- **Kernel**: Core component always running
- **Shell**: Interface between user and kernel
  - Bourne Shell, Korn Shell, and C Shell

### Access:
- Remote access via tools like SSH (e.g., it-shell.insearch.edu.au)
